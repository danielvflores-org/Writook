OBJECTIVES:
=======
This document aims to provide a clear and concise view of the purpose and objectives of my project's fork. It details the goals the project should cover as well as the benefits we expect to achieve for users and the community in general.

PROJECT PURPOSE:
-----------------------
The main purpose of this fork is to improve and adapt the original project to meet specific needs that are not being adequately addressed. This includes adding new features, optimizing performance, and improving the user experience.

On a personal level, I want to understand the project's code and learn from it. The base version forced me to learn many new concepts, and I will use tools (including AI assistance) to support that process.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
-----------------------
1. Refactor the existing code to improve readability and maintainability.
2. Add new features that meet users' needs.
3. Optimize the project's performance to ensure a smooth experience (for example: a more responsive backend, avoiding the need for manual page reloads to see data).
4. Improve documentation to make the project easier to understand and use for new contributors.
5. Recreate functions and features from the original version that may have been lost or changed during development.
6. Establish a sustainable long-term project with an active community of contributors.

EXPECTED BENEFITS:
-----------------------
- Be able to address the shortcomings of the original version.
- Learn and understand the codebase.
- Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing within the community.
- Provide a more robust and adaptable tool for end users.
- Create a solid foundation for future developments and continuous improvements.

CONCLUSION:
-----------------------
This fork represents an opportunity to significantly improve the original project by adapting it to current and future needs. By implementing the objectives set out here, we hope to create a valuable resource for both users and the developer community.
Ultimately, the goal is to learn and build something useful and functional.
Thank you for reading this document and for your interest in the project.

PROJECT STATUS:
-----------------------
Personal / experimental work. Currently I am the only one developing this fork. Later, if I decide to open it to contributions, I will add a guide and rules for collaborating.

CONTRIBUTIONS:
-----------------------
At the moment I am not accepting external contributions. When the project reaches a stable state and I announce it, I will include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` section with guidelines for collaboration.

LICENSE:
-----------------------
Please refer to the `LICENSE` file at the root of the repository for applicable terms. If one does not exist, a suitable license will be added and noted here.

ROADMAP (brief):
-----------------------
- Immediate priority: refactor critical modules and improve backend responsiveness.
- Next steps: add the most requested new features and improve the reading/editing experience.
- Mid-term: strengthen automated tests and documentation to facilitate contributions.

NOTE ON AI:
-----------------------
I will use AI assistance as a supporting tool for learning, refactoring, and idea generation. All final decisions, code reviews and designs will be made and validated by me.
